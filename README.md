# Insights
1.Overall energy consumed in all the attributes over the years (2016-2019) were 210M. out of this water attribute has consumed 88.49% , which is 87% higher than Gas consumed units.

2.Gradually the price and units consumed increased over the years, which shows the increases in population. But in 2019 the water consumed units is decreased 4%  due to 10% increase in price per unit.

3.New york city has consumed high units in in terms of water and Gas energy. Houston and Phoenix with the least.

4.Almost same amount of units consumed by all the Buildings over the years.

5.Overall cost of 210M units consumed over the years is $15.84M , out of this water has generated 68.2% of amount.

6.Most of the units consumed on the month April and on particularly Fridays over the years.
# Recommendations

1. Implement Energy-Efficient Appliances

Replace old water heaters, air conditioners, and cooking appliances with energy-efficient models (e.g., ENERGY STAR-rated) that use less water, gas, and electricity, reducing overall consumption.



2. Optimize Heating and Cooling Systems

Regularly service HVAC systems, insulate pipes and ducts, and use programmable thermostats to maintain energy efficiency. Set optimal temperature ranges to avoid excessive gas and electricity usage.



3. Use Water-Saving Fixtures

Install low-flow faucets, showerheads, and dual-flush toilets to reduce water wastage, which in turn lessens the need for energy to heat water, lowering both water and energy bills.



4. Adopt Smart Lighting and Power Management

Use LED lights and motion sensors, and unplug devices when not in use to prevent "phantom" electricity usage. Smart lighting controls can also adjust based on occupancy and daylight, reducing electricity consumption.



5. Promote Behavioral Changes and Awareness

Encourage shorter showers, mindful cooking practices (like using the right burner size), and turning off unused lights and appliances. Educating on energy-saving habits helps reduce both immediate and long-term energy consumption across all utilities.
